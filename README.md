# go-do
project referenced from hub/docker/kbuild/dospaces_backup/.env and Dockerfile

Forked here becuase it seems (I'm not 100% sure) to be referenced here https://bitbucket.org/scientificeducationsupport/hub/src/master/docker/kbuild/dospaces_backup/

Looks to me like a Docker image from this is in the registry 

Looks like a backup of digital ocean to AWS ?
